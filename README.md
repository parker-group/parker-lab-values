# Parker Group Values and Expectations
*Updated: 24.11.13*

---

## Collegiality

- Be welcoming to one another and proactive in opening up discussions or offering assistance.  
- Collaborations within and outside of the group are key to success (e.g., sharing data, code, protocols, and helping each other). The best global health work comes from teams.  
- Share and celebrate both achievements and failures.  
- Be open to giving and receiving feedback.  
- There’s no competition within the group, but always try your best.  
- **Our approach:** Demonstrate that a kinder, more thoughtful, and collaborative scientific process is as effective — or more so — than competitive and ruthless methods.  
- Collaboration should be the rule within our group.  
- Being direct is fine, but always be kind.  
- Remember: Sharing is caring.

## Work-Life Balance

### Productivity Over Hours Logged
- Hard work is essential, but in academia, what you accomplish matters more than how long you spend at your desk.  
- Your CV reflects your outputs — publications, presentations, and other contributions — not the hours you worked.  
- Productivity requires consistent effort and time. Achieving meaningful results comes from putting in the necessary work to reach your goals.  

### The Role of Stress
- Stress, when managed well, can be a useful driving force. A healthy level of stress keeps us motivated and focused on achieving our goals.  
- However, too much or overly negative stress can become paralyzing, preventing progress and harming well-being.  
- On the other hand, if you find yourself unworried about meeting deadlines or delivering results, it also indicates larger problems.  

### Don’t Neglect Mental and Physical Health
- Prioritizing your well-being enhances your ability to be productive.  
- Overworking without delivering results is not sustainable or effective.  

**Bottom Line**  
- Time spent should translate into tangible outcomes. Simply logging hours isn’t enough — focus on creating something valuable. If you're struggling with stress or translating effort into output, let’s strategize together to find a healthy balance.  
- “We missed you, but do you really need to be here? Go take a walk!” Inspiration often strikes when you're active.

## Diversity and Inclusion

### Equity and Justice
- Global health and epidemiology have both historically been dominated by males from wealthy, predominantly white countries.  
- To address equity and justice, leadership of these fields must reflect the populations it serves.  

### Improved Work Quality
- Diverse perspectives enrich research. Surrounding yourself with colleagues who bring different experiences improves the quality of work.

## Work Quality

**Do good work.**  
- High-quality research doesn’t require publication in prestigious journals like *Lancet*, *Nature*, *Science*, or *Cell*.  
- What matters most is that your work is logical, sound, and thoughtfully designed to answer meaningful questions, even simple ones.  

**Prioritize rigor over speed.**  
- You need research outputs for your degree and career, but it’s far better to delay a presentation or publication if the methods and results are not yet solid.  
- Always aim for your work to be presentable, defensible, and credible.  

**Know your work.**  
- Even with support in developing your methods and analysis, you must be able to confidently defend your decisions, methods, and results.  
- If you can’t explain it, take the time to figure it out.  

**Your reputation matters (and so does the reputation of the Parker Group).**  
- High productivity is impressive, but poor-quality work can quickly undermine your reputation. A single low-quality presentation or publication can negate the positive impression of your previous efforts.  
- Always strive for excellence, even in smaller-scale projects.

## Productivity

**Becoming an independent scholar**  
- Aim to become an independent scholar. This is your apprenticeship.  
- Start with one research output per year and increase as soon as you are able.  
- Early in your degree (1st–2nd year): Focus on posters or oral presentations (I’m happy to help you reach these goals).  
- Later: Shift toward peer-reviewed publications, which are more valuable for your CV and the lab.  
- Papers are much, much more valuable than posters and talks — for you and your future, and for the lab.  
- Research outputs snowball over time — what feels small now can grow into multiple outputs annually.  
- Feeling overwhelmed? Let’s talk! I can help you move things along.  

**Optimize Your Schedule**  
- Identify when your brain works best and structure your day accordingly.  
  *Example: I’m most creative in the early morning, so I reserve that time for writing.*  
- Adapt as you gain more control of your time. While some tasks require adherence to external schedules, increasingly during your PhD, you’ll have control over your time — use it wisely.

## Lifelong Learning and Proactive Skill Development

**Early in the program:**  
- You’ll engage in coursework, much of it focused on methods. Some methods will be directly applicable to your research, while others may not be immediately relevant (but could be useful later).  

**Later in the program (3rd year and beyond):**  
- Expect to learn new methods and techniques outside of formal coursework.  
- Be proactive about acquiring new skills. Opportunities for learning (e.g., basic mapping workshops) will arise, but increasingly, you’ll need to figure out how to learn independently.  

**Develop the ability to learn effectively:**  
- This involves understanding both how you learn best and when and how to seek help.  
- Strategies might include:  
  - Finding the right books, tutorials, or online courses.  
  - Reaching out to experts for guidance on specific methodologies.  
- The sooner you master this, the better off you’ll be. It’s a skill you’ll likely rely on even after your PhD.

## Mentorship

**Success in research requires a team of mentors.**  
- No single mentor (yes, including me!) can provide everything you’ll need.  
- Seek out mentors with diverse lived experiences (e.g., different ethnicities, genders) and a variety of skill sets (e.g., GIS, genetics, qualitative approaches, ecology).  
- I (Daniel) still meet with old mentors and seek out new mentors.  

**Mentorship doesn’t always come with formal titles.**  
- Not all mentors will serve in official capacities (e.g., on your committee). This is both fine and beneficial.  
- However, strive to make these mentorships mutually rewarding when possible.  
  *For example, if they helped you with methods or interpretations that wind up in a paper, especially outside of a classroom setting, find a way for them to be a coauthor. If they’re unofficially mentoring you without recognition, consider nominating them for a mentorship award.*  

**Be mindful of ‘ghost mentorship.’**  
- This occurs when students rely heavily on individuals (faculty or otherwise) who are not their official advisors. These mentors often go unrecognized, while the primary advisor — frequently a high-ranking figure — receives undue credit for the student’s progress.  
- Try to avoid perpetuating this system. Acknowledge and credit those who actively mentor you.  

**Manage your mentorship relationships.**  
- Keep in touch with your mentors regularly (e.g., touch base quarterly).  
- You’re busy, but they are likely busier. Help them keep up with you by being proactive with finding times to meet, putting those meetings on their calendar, etc.  
- Develop meaningful relationships by valuing their time, experience, and expertise.  
- Be respectful of their advice and integrate their feedback thoughtfully into your work.
